    "## CSCE 554 Homework 1 - Introduction to Julia for Data Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal: The objective of this homework is to become familiar with Julia programming by reproducing some of the statistical results associated with the Use Cases as presented in Chapter 1 of The Statistical Sleuth 3rd Edition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Motivation and Creativity - A Randomized Experiment\n",
    "* Read case study.\n",
    "* Read the dataset for this case study into Julia (case0101.csv). Hint: load data into a dataframe.\n",
    "* Display an abbreviated view of the raw data loaded.\n",
    "* Calculate and display the following information about the creativity scores for both the intrinsic and extrinsic groups: sample size, average, and sample standard deviation by creating and calling your own Julia functions.  In other words, duplicate the summary statistics as shown in Display 1.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sex Discrimination in Employment - An Observational Study\n",
    "* Read case study.\n",
    "* Read the dataset for this case study into Julia (case0102.csv). Hint: load data into a dataframe.\n",
    "* Display an abbreviated view of the raw data loaded.\n",
    "* Use the available functions in the Julia StatsBase package to calculate and display the following information about the salaries for both Males and Females: sample size, average, and sample standard deviation. In other words, provide summary statistics for the data sown in Display 1.3.\n",

    "For each case study, show and explain work through by adding and editing the cells below.  Turn in both the notebook and a PDF rendering of it via email.  Use my personal email to avoid transmission problems (doug@sidechannel.net). Use the following naming convention: &lt;lastname&gt;-hw01.ipynb, and  &lt;lastname&gt;-hw01.pdf (e.g., hodson-hw01.ipynb and hodson-hw01.pdf)."
